I'm a software engineer who went from debugging people to debugging computers; who went from ICU to APIs.

**My superpower?** 
I see systems the way nurses see patients: holistically, with obsessive attention to detail, 
and an unshakeable sense of responsibility when things break. While other engineers optimize for performance, 
I optimize for reliability – because I've seen what happens when critical systems fail people who depend on them.

**My philosophy:** 
> "If life gives you lemonade, make lemons – and life will be all like 'whaaaaat?'" -- Phil Dunphy


I find **FUN** in impossible situations. 
I love that "aha!" moment when a complex problem suddenly clicks. 
I thrive on the fresh insights that come from trying new approaches. 
Innovation isn't just about solving problems – it's about *enjoying* the process, even (especially?) when it's hard.
