I am a Software Engineer currently completing my Master's at **Cornell Tech** with 5+ YoE in backend development, specializing in building high-scale distributed systems and integrating Generative AI into production environments.

My engineering philosophy blends deep technical rigor with product strategy. With a background in **Venture Capital due diligence** and **product management**, I don't just write code; I design systems that balance latency, scalability, and business ROI.
